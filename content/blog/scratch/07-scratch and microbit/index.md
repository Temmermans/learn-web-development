## #1 Goal for this course

> By the end of this course, **I want you to be able to learn what Micro:bit is and how to combine robotics with code.**

### What is Micro:bit?

The Micro:bit is a small computer that you can use to code and create projects. It has a 5x5 LED display, buttons, sensors, and many other features that you can use to create interactive projects.

### Linking Scratch and Micro:bit

Install the Scratch Link software on your computer and connect your Micro:bit to it. You can find it on the following link: [Scratch Link](https://scratch.mit.edu/microbit).

Download the Scratch Micro:bit HEX file from the following link: [Scratch HEX](https://downloads.scratch.mit.edu/microbit/scratch-microbit.hex.zip).

Drop the HEX file into your Micro:bit and you're ready to go!

### Creating a Project

Connect the Micro:bit to your computer and open Scratch.
